    "**In general, the number of ways to select k distinct items without replacement from n items in any order is (nk) = n!/(n-k)!k!. You can show that here are k! times more permutations than combinations when you choose k items from n items without replacement. That's because the formula for a permutation is n!/(n-k)!, while the formula for a combination is n!/(n-k)!k!. If you take k! times the combination formula, you get the permuation formula. That means it takes k! combinations to equal one permuation (which is true because with a combination, you don't care hoe those k items are arranged, and with a permutation, you do)**\n",
